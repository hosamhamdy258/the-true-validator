Understanding the Egyptian National ID Number

The Egyptian National ID number is a 14-digit number that encodes specific personal information about the individual.

Here's how to read it:

1. 1st Digit – Century of Birth
   - Indicates the century in which the person was born:
     - "2" = 20th century (1900–1999)
     - "3" = 21st century (2000 and beyond)

2. 2nd & 3rd Digits – Year of Birth
   - Represents the last two digits of the birth year.
     - Example: "99" = 1999, "01" = 2001

3. 4th & 5th Digits – Month of Birth
   - Indicates the month the person was born.
     - Example: "01" = January, "12" = December

4. 6th & 7th Digits – Day of Birth
   - Represents the day of the month the person was born.
     - Example: "15" = 15th day

5. 8th & 9th Digits – Governorate Code
   - Refers to the governorate where the birth certificate was issued.

6. 10th to 13th Digits – Serial Number
   - A unique number to distinguish individuals born on the same day in the same governorate.
   - The 13th digit (last one in this segment) indicates gender:
     - Odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) = Male
     - Even number (2, 4, 6, 8) = Female

7. 14th Digit – Check Digit
   - A verification number used to confirm the validity of the national ID.

Example: 29801011401891
